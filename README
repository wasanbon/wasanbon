`wasanbon` is a framework for Robotic Software Developers with Robotic Technology Middleware (RT-middleware).

Robotic Technology Middleware is a standard for Robotic Softwares. In RTM, each software element (like actuator, sensor, algorithm, and so on) is regarded as Robotic Technology Component (RTC). Using RTM, developers can create their robot software with constructing of those software components. 

Each RTC has ports as data-trasnporting endpoints, and a statemachine. To construct RT-system, connection between ports, and state activation is indispensable. To launch multiple RTCs also disturbs developers. `wasanbon` automates multiple RTC development in some aspects.
